# Introduction 
This is an implementation (or the start of) .Gov.uk's https://design-system.service.gov.uk/ design system in .Net

See https://govuknet.azurewebsites.net/ for a published version

#ToDo 
 - Implement all of the components
 - Document all the things
 - Make the Library into a NuGet package
 - Include text making it clear this is not Government / Government supported
 - Document usage, contribution and support

I am aiming to meet the [criteria](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#developing-a-community-resource-or-tool) here. The following list is to demonstrate this (or show work still to be done).

* It has a clear owner - thats me, David Joseph [@scrambledheads on Twitter](https://twitter.com/scrambledheads)
* It cannot be mistaken for an official resource - I point this out in the text of the site implementation and on here 
* It has documentation explaining how to use it, contribute to it and get support for it. - Added to #ToDo list
* Support tickets are answered within 1 month - I have none at the moment but I can do this
* It’s clearly documented which version of GOV.UK Frontend it supports - I have documented this in this readme first paragraph, on the site implementation of this and will include in the documentation 
* It’s no more than 3 months behind the latest version of GOV.UK Frontend design resources are consistent with the styles, components and patterns in the GOV.UK Design System - This is using the latest version of the design system and uses little beyond this.
* Development resources output the same markup as GOV.UK Frontend - Yes, the intent is this should be identical with it being a bug if it doesn't
* It isn’t being charged for or used to promote a private business - As I say at the start of this and [my blog](https://scrambledheads.medium.com/gov-uk-net-9b075f28c194) this was intended to show the implementation of a Design System using .Net and grew from there.
* It’s compatible with the Service Standard and Technology code of practice - I believe this is the case.
